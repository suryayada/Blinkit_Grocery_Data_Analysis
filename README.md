project Blinkit Analysis, involves analyzing sales data from a dataset named blinkit_data. Here's a breakdown of what you've done:

1. Data Importation and Cleaning
Imported data using SELECT * FROM blinkit_data.
Cleaned the Item_Fat_Content column to standardize values (LF, low fat → Low Fat and reg → Regular).
Verified cleaning using SELECT DISTINCT Item_Fat_Content FROM blinkit_data.
2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
You extracted key business metrics:

Total Sales: Summed up all sales and presented the result in millions.
Average Sales: Computed the average value of sales.
Number of Orders: Counted the total number of transactions.
Average Rating: Calculated the average customer rating.
3. Sales Analysis
You performed various analyses on sales data:

Total Sales by Fat Content: Grouped sales data by Item_Fat_Content.
Total Sales by Item Type: Summed sales for each product category and sorted results in descending order.
Sales by Outlet and Fat Content: Used a PIVOT query to show total sales per Outlet_Location_Type for each Item_Fat_Content category (Low Fat & Regular).
4. Outlet-Based Analysis
Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year: Showed how much sales each outlet year contributed.
Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size: Used a window function to calculate each outlet size's contribution to total sales.
Sales by Outlet Location: Summed sales for each Outlet_Location_Type.
All Metrics by Outlet Type: Combined multiple KPIs, including Total Sales, Avg Sales, No. of Items Sold, Avg Rating, and Item Visibility, grouped by Outlet_Type.
Technical Highlights
Used SQL Aggregations (SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()) to derive insights.
Implemented Data Cleaning techniques (UPDATE with CASE).
Used Pivoting (PIVOT function) to structure sales data by Item_Fat_Content and Outlet_Location_Type.
Utilized Window Functions (SUM() OVER()) to compute percentages of total sales by outlet size.
